## March 28th - April 3rd, 2025
Started to come up with ideas of how I should design everything, and how everythign should function, including a safe way of powering the Arduino NANO and other electrical components to control the Solenoid Valve.

Designed and printed more components, some are permenent, some are prototypes.

Completed most of the rear structure, added stuff like the grip, trigger in which uses a 3D printed trigger and momentary button to the circuit and solenoid valve, also cut some aluminum tubes to a good length from grip to buttstock, then printed the stock, and also a pad for the buttstock out of TPU for better comfort, and absorb the minor recoil of the system.

Time spent during those dates - All weekend and all of my free time during the week day


## March 3rd - Present, 2025

Was unable to complete this project as the components cost more than I was able to pay for at the time, looking forward to completing this project though!
