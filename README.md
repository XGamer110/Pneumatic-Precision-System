# Pneumatic Precision System (PPS)

This Pneumatic Precision System (PPS) is a homemade high performance **air rifle** designed for controlled projectile launching using compressed air at up to 100 PSI. Built from scratch as a personal engineering project, this PPS achieves a calculated muzzle velocity that exceeds 450 FPS, making it suitable for precision target practice and responsible small game pest control on private land.

While technically classified as an air rifle, this system was developed to explore the physics of pneumatic propulsion, motion dynamics, and energy transfer, using off shelf parts and hand built and designed components. The project demonstrates a functional and efficient method for delivering consistent shots of 3D printed pellets, in which were extensively researched, mathematically modeled, carefully refined to maximize aerodynamic stability, and consistent flight performance under such conditions. All construction and usage of this device are conducted with safety and legality as top priorities.

Basic Solenoid Electronics - Designed for the solenoid valve to open for 200ms to fill up the QEV, close, then rapidly release the pressure in one **very** quick burst, propelling the projectile at 450+ FPS.
